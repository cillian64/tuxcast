Intro

Tuxcast is a podcatcher.  It downloads enclosures from an RSS feed, also known as podcasts, even though tuxcast can download any file with an enclosure.

It's written in c++, using the libxml2 library to parse RSS feeds, POSIX libraries for filesytstem stuff, and libcurl to download the files.

Tuxcast uses a command line interface; there are no current plans for a GUI.
