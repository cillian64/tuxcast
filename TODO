* Resuming incomplete downloads
* Remove the need to "numoffeeds" in the config file (loop through the feeds and count them, or something)
* Clear up xml stuff at the end of functions
* Sanity checks in tuxcast-config, i.e. not adding feeds with a duplicate name, deleting non-existant feeds, etc.
* Putting podcasts in directories
* Customizable directories for each feed
* Ignoring particular file types (i.e. videos, etc.), or putting them in special directories
* Where to save the config file, defined in compile_flags.h
	(this could help portability)
