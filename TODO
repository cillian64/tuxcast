* Resuming incomplete downloads
* Remove the need to "numoffeeds" in the config file (loop through the feeds and count them, or something)
* Clear up xml stuff at the end of functions
* Sanity checks in tuxcast-config, i.e. not adding feeds with a duplicate name, deleting non-existant feeds, etc.
* Putting podcasts in directories
* Customizable directories for each feed
* Ignoring particular file types (i.e. videos, etc.), or putting them in special directories
* Making the ~/.tuxcast directory if it doesn't exist
* Not trying to read the config file if it doesn't exist (this doesn't really break anything, but causes errors)
