* Resuming incomplete downloads
* Clear up xml stuff at the end of functions
* Ignoring particular file types (i.e. videos, etc.), or putting them in special directories
* Where to save the config file, defined in compile_flags.h
	(this could help portability)
* More folder sanity checking
* Bittorrenting
* Exceptions (The socket library is already done, other libraries and functions
	should follow suite including tuxcast->amarok)
* Check no exceptions from the filestuff library can slip through
* Change all libxml parses to be non-verbose (and not spit out errors)
* Add GPL to all new files (Including tuxcast->amarok).
* Change filelist to a typedef, and things that reference it (At the moment it's
	a class only containing a vector - waste of time + space)
* Enter RSS 1.0 mode if the root tag is RDF instead of checking for no items
