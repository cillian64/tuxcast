Checking feeds
---------------

This will download ALL new episodes in all feeds.  If there are 100 episodes you haven't downloaded before, it'll download them all.  You have been warned.

To check all feed:
tuxcast -c

To check a particular feed:
tuxcast -C NAME

Updating Feeds
--------------

OK, I admit that's a pretty stupid name.  What this feature ACTUALLY does, is, it downloads the latest episode in a feed.  It just marks the rest as downloaded.  This is useful when you first subscribe to a feed, or come back off holiday, etc. and you only want the latest episode.

To update all feeds:
tuxcast -u

To update a particular feed:
tuxcast -U NAME

Other bits
