Basic configuration
-------------------

All configuration is stored in an XML config file, at ~/.tuxcast/config.xml.  You can create this file manually, but it's much easier and reccommended to create and edit it using the tuxcast-config program.

You should setup your basic options (below) before adding any feeds or trying to use tuxcast.  If you don't do this, things can get messy

If you don't already have a configuration file, tuxcast-config will make one for you as soon as you change an option or add a feed.

Options
-------

Options are set like this:
tuxcast-config -s option=value
Only one option can be set at a time.

Currently, the options are:
o podcastdir - this can be any absolute directory (must start with /, no ~ allowed).  This is the root of where all podcasts are saved.
o ask - this can be either "true" or "false".  If true, you will be asked before every file is downloaded, if you want to download it or not.

Feeds
-----

This is the most important part of configuration.  Feeds can be added, removed, or edited.

To add feeds:
tuxcast-config -a -n NAME -A ADDRESS -f FOLDER
Note the options are case sensitive.  NAME and ADDRESS cannot be blank.  However, FOLDER can be blank, if you don't want to put this particular podcast's files in any folder - just use -f "".
If you want a space in any of these values, make sure to put "s before and after it.

To remove a feed:
tuxcast-config -d NAME
This will remove the feed named NAME.

To change a feed's details:
If you want to change the folder, use:
tuxcast-config -u -n NAME -f NEWFOLDER
As before, for a blank folder, use -f ""

To change the feed's address, use:
tuxcast-config -u -n NAME -A NEWADDRESS
NEWADDRESS must not be blank.

At the moment, you cannot change a feed's name.
