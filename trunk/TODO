* Resuming incomplete downloads
* Clear up xml stuff at the end of functions (try valgrind for mem checking?)
* Ignoring particular file types (i.e. videos, etc.), or putting them in special directories
* Where to save the config file, defined in compile_flags.h
	(this could help portability)
* More folder sanity checking
* Bittorrenting
* Check no exceptions from the filestuff library can slip through
* Change all libxml parses to be non-verbose (and not spit out errors)
* Clean up foldery stuff.
* Create root podcast folder, maybe ask?
* Either add a spinner or enable libcurl support for one (If it has one)
* Stop warnings about missing config.xml and files.xml on first runs
* Stop duplicate named or URL'ed feed (Didn't I already do it?)
* Stop having both -c and -u
* Feeds containing an &, as in a GET form, don't play nicely with the XML.
