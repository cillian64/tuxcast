* Resuming incomplete downloads (I think it already does this, ust need to confirm)
* Clear up xml stuff at the end of functions (try valgrind for mem checking?)
* Ignoring particular file types (i.e. videos, etc.), or putting them in special directories
* Where to save the config file, defined in compile_flags.h
	(this could help portability)
* More folder sanity checking
* Bittorrenting (with rtorrent, not the rb one)
* Check no exceptions from the filestuff library can slip through
* Change all libxml parses to be non-verbose (and not spit out errors)
* Clean up foldery stuff.
* Stop warnings about missing config.xml and files.xml on first runs
* Feeds containing an &, as in a GET form, don't play nicely with the XML. (Can't really do anything
	about this as this makes the XML invalid so libxml is right to abort...)
* Populate the type property of the file for atom feeds
* Alter makefiles to make PCRE++ optional
* Check all calls use exceptions
