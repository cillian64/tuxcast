* Resuming incomplete downloads (Rather hard to do at the moment)
* Clear up xml stuff at the end of functions (Confirmed that libcurl and libxml
	are currently *not* cleaned up properly)
* Where to save the config file, defined in compile_flags.h
	(this could help portability)
* More folder sanity checking
* Check no exceptions from the filestuff library can slip through
* Change all libxml parses to be non-verbose (and not spit out errors)
* Stop warnings about missing config.xml and files.xml on first runs
* Feeds containing an &, as in a GET form, don't play nicely with the XML.
	(Can't really do anything about this as this makes the XML invalid so
	libxml is right to abort...)
* Populate the type property of the file for atom feeds
* Check all calls use exceptions
* Update man pages (Seriously needs doing)
